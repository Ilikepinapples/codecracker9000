The plan goes as follows:
build a comprehensive cipher braking and making program:
possibly using this as a source of cracking methods
https://www.cipherchallenge.org/library/ (refer to the technical section)

Additionally all functionality of this should be covered as well:
https://www.cipherchallenge.org/tools/

for substitution and frequncy analysis while single letter analysis, a more comprehensive frequency analysis should also be used using the data on this page:

**Notices**
* Please use ```namespace Cypher.Utils``` as the namespace for all the programs (just paste at the top)
