The plan goes as follows:
build a comprehensive cipher braking and making program:
possibly using this as a source of cracking methods
https://www.cipherchallenge.org/library/ (refer to the technical section)

Additionally all functionality of this should be covered as well:
https://www.cipherchallenge.org/tools/

for substitution and frequncy analysis while single letter analysis is implemented it is unrealiable and so, a more comprehensive frequency analysis should also be used using the data on this page:
http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/english-letter-frequencies/
a system that is flexible and can take in an input of any of the files here to use with frequnecy analysis should also be able to allow for support of other languages fairly easily making this a good idea

**Notices**
* Please use ```namespace Cypher.Utils``` as the namespace for all the programs (just paste at the top)
* (this may change in future if the program grows to the stage that multiple namespaces are required to organise various classes but this should not be a problem for the forseable future)
